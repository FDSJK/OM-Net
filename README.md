# OM-Net

This is the code release for the MICCIA 2018 paper "One-Pass Multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks for Efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation", authored by Chenhong Zhou, Changxing Ding, Zhentai Lu, Xinchao Wang and Dacheng Tao.


This work overcomes the shortcomings of popular model cascade strategy that can lead to undesired system complexity and ignore the relevance among the models due to its multiple separate cascaded models. We propose to adopt multi-task learning to integrate multiple segmentation tasks into a deep model which is called *One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net)*.

OM-Net exploits correlation among tasks to achieve superior performance, with only one-third model parameters of model cascade strategy and one-pass computation. It ranks 1st on the BraTS 2015 test set and achieves top performance on BraTS 2017 validation set.


## Model



All implementations are based on the [C3D](https://github.com/facebook/C3D), which is a 3D modified version of BVLC caffe.

Please clone the C3D repository and add these files.
