# OM-Net

This is the code release for the MICCIA 2018 paper "One-Pass Multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks for Efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation", authored by Chenhong Zhou, Changxing Ding, Zhentai Lu, Xinchao Wang and Dacheng Tao.


This work overcomes the shortcomings of popular model cascade strategy that can lead to undesired system complexity and ignore the relevance among the models due to its multiple cascaded separate models. We propose to adopt multi-task learning to integrate multiple segmentation tasks into a deep model which is called One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net).








All implementations are based on the [C3D](https://github.com/facebook/C3D), which is a 3D modified version of BVLC caffe.

Please clone the C3D repository and add these files.


To be continued.
